## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- npm (comes with Node.js)
- A **Google Gemini API key** — [get one free here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

---

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheVoidJulius/digital-brain.git
cd digital-brain
```

---

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

### 3. Set Up Your Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project:

```bash
touch .env
```

Then open it and add your Gemini API key:

```env
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

> ⚠️ **Important:** The variable name **must** start with `VITE_` for Vite to expose it to the frontend.

> 🔒 Never share or commit your `.env` file. It's already listed in `.gitignore` to keep your key safe.

### 4. Run the App Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.
